My Favorite Denim!
==================
## Vintage Levis
> The fast fashion industry is realling taking a toll on our environment because quite frankly, there clothes are made up of cheap quality that people often throw away. So, why not reuse some clothes and buy second-hand? Vintage levis are the go-to in my opinion and you can thousands of listing on sites such as Grailed for anywhere between $30-$70. I'm telling you, Grailed is a GOLDMINE. Of course, there are a lot of different fits, but my favorite when it comes to Vintage Levis are the straighter, baggy cuts. As for the wash, you could go anything, but my personal favorite are lighter wash jeans because they are more casual and they look the best with flannels (in my opinion). However, if you don't like the whole vintage "vibe" and want something more traditional, like menswear, I feel you. That is where our next pair of denim comes in.

## Kollar Clothing
> I discovered this brand back in 2019 and I love it. First, let's talk about their customer service, which is spot on. They always respond to my DMs on instagram and emails within a few days which most brands don't even do. David Kollar and his team are great designers too, especially for that grunge, punk, rock and roll feel. Okay, details on the denim. They have multiple fits but what I recommend getting are the "rockstar skinnies" cut and the "slim-straight." You could already guess the fit by the name. Super stretchy denim, great fits, and will last you for years with great care. It's really soft. However, the price is a bit steep, starting at $129 (I do not recommend you pay full price. Look for deals, or buy second hand which is what I do). If you get a pair of these, you won't be dissapointed.

## APC
> Full discloser, APC is **expensive**. HOWEVER, even though there is a reason for the price, I would strongly recommend that you do not pay full price and get it second hand, which is what I do for a lot of these higher end denim. You could say 75% at times, you just have to be patient! Thank you. Anyway, APC denim is not your traditional denim. It's raw, meaning that it is unwashed and initially a dark blue color (I'm not really too much of any expert, Mr. Dalley is) but that basically means the more you wear it, the more the pants fades, the more marks it will get, the more beautiful it becomes. People wear denim like this for 6 years! Yes, it's a bigger investment but if you love denim and are planning on wearing it for a long time, these will last. Although, you probably have to repair the crotch area as constant wear will tear it (called a *"crotch" blowout*). Also, typically, you would wash these every 6 months, and hang dry to really get those nice fades. But, you could always soak thetm and use a little detergent in a bucket just for a quick refresher on the denim.
